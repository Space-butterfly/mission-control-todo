## 🧠 Features
- 🔐 Encrypts messages using Fernet (AES-based)
- 🛰️ Authenticates signals to prevent tampering
- 🧮 Demonstrates satellite cyber defense concepts
- 🌐 Simple web interface (Flask + HTML + JS)

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- Python (Flask)
- Cryptography (Fernet)
- Flask-CORS
- HTML / CSS / JavaScript

---

## ⚙️ How to Run
